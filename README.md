# Project Title: End-to-End Data Pipeline for Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline that captures, processes, and visualizes weather data for analysis. The pipeline gathers data from a public API, processes it for trend analysis, and stores it in a data warehouse for reporting.

### Objectives:
- Collect weather data for a specific city or country
- Process and transform the data for analysis
- Store processed data in a data warehouse
- Create visualizations to track temperature trends over time

---

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Source**: Pull real-time weather data from a public API like OpenWeatherMap.
- **Data Retrieval**: Schedule API calls to collect temperature, humidity, and weather condition data every hour.
- **Tools**: Use Python with libraries like `requests` for API calls and Airflow for scheduling ingestion tasks.

### 2. Data Processing
- **Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize temperature units.
- **Transformation**: Create derived columns, such as temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, and categorize weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
- **Frameworks**: Use `Pandas` for data manipulation and `Apache Spark` for handling larger data sets.

### 3. Data Storage
- **Warehouse**: Store the transformed data in a cloud data warehouse such as Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.
- **Schema Design**: Design tables for storing raw and processed data, optimized for querying.

### 4. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Data Analysis**: Run queries to analyze seasonal trends, daily temperature variations, and average conditions by month.
- **Visualization**: Create a dashboard in Tableau or Power BI to display trends, such as:
  - Monthly average temperature
  - Daily temperature fluctuations
  - Most frequent weather conditions

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Logging**: Track pipeline performance and errors in each stage.
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts (e.g., in Airflow) for failed ingestion jobs.
- **Documentation**: Document the pipelineâ€™s steps, configurations, and requirements.
